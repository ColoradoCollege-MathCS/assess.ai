To get METEOR working:

Download the punkt_tab.zip file in the github and put it somewhere easy to find (desktop, downloads, etc)

Navigate to Users/admin_user folder
	For example, Users/jane_doe

Unzip punkt_tab.zip

Create a folder called nltk_data

Go into the folder

Create a folder named tokenizers

Place the unzipped foulder punkt_tab inside the tokenizers folder

Navigate to terminal and run python3 download_nltk.py

Download the third-party item in the collections tab

Navigate to the corpa tab

download the wordnet and omw-1.4 items

Close the tab

In terminal run <bash '/Applications/Python 3.9/Install Certificates.command'>
	Do not include <>
	If your Python is not 3.9 or it throws an error here, run in terminal run python3 --version
	Take the first two numbers and replace Python 3.9 with whatever version
	Do not include the end number

Run the test_eval.py file and test if it produces a number

It will run a few download commands as well

This works as of 1/30/25
