To get METEOR working:

Download the punkt_tab.zip file in the github and put it somewhere easy to find (desktop, downloads, etc)

Navigate to Users/admin_user folder
	For example, Users/jane_doe
	You can easily do this by searching for a file in Finder, highlight on one of the items (but do not open it), and look for the location at the bottom. You can click into your user folder or Macintosh HD
	If you click into Macintosh HD, click into Users, then into your folder

Unzip punkt_tab.zip

Create a folder called nltk_data

Go into the folder

Create a folder named tokenizers

Place the unzipped foulder punkt_tab inside the tokenizers folder

Navigate to terminal and run python3 download_nltk.py

Navigate to the corpa tab

download the wordnet and omw-1.4 items

Close the tab

In terminal run <bash '/Applications/Python 3.9/Install Certificates.command'>
	Do not include <>
	If your Python is not 3.9 or it throws an error here, run in terminal <python3 --version>
	Do not include <>
	Take the first two numbers and replace Python 3.9 with whatever version
	Do not include the end number

Run python3 test_eval.py in terminal and test if it produces a number

It will run a few download commands as well

This works as of 1/30/25
