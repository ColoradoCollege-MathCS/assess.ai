The patient\nhas tried and failed conservative treatment. The patient has an MRI showing a full-thickness\nrotator cuff tear. They wished to proceed with surgery, fully understanding risks, benefits, pros\nand cons.\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nThe patient was seen in the preoperative area where the history, physical examination, and\ninformed consent was reviewed. The patient understood all risks and benefits of surgery\nincluding the risk of infection, the risk of damage to nearby nerves, arteries, veins, tendons,\nneed for subsequent operation, implant failure or loosening, failure of repair, retear, stiffness.\nThe patient wished to proceed. Right upper extremity was marked. Regional anesthetic block\nwas placed to the Right upper extremity by the Anesthesia team.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table. Timeout\nwas performed, confirming the patient's correct identification as well as the correct operative\nsite. IV Ancef was given as infection prophylaxis. General anesthesia was induced without\ncomplications. The patient was placed in the beach chair position with all bony prominences\nwell-padded, and the Right upper extremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.\nTimeout was performed prior to incision.\nPosterior arthroscopic portal was established. Diagnostic arthroscopy was performed\nconfirming the following: Degenerative fraying of the anterior superior posterior labrum. Articular\ncartilage fraying of the humeral head and glenoid with no full-thickness cartilage defect. Intact\nsubscapularis. Long head of the biceps tendon fraying. Large full-thickness tear of the\nsupraspinatus extending into the infraspinatus with retraction. Intact posterior cuff\nAt this point, a rotator interval portal was established, and a shaver was introduced in the joint.\nDebridement of the degenerative labral fraying was performed. Debridement of articular\ncartilage of the humeral head and glenoid was performed. Debridement of the rotator interval\nsynovitis and capsule was performed. A straight biter was used to perform a biceps tenotomy for\nlater tenodesis and the residual stump was debrided with the shaver. The scope was then\nmoved to the subacromial space using the previously established posterior arthroscopic portal.\nLateral portal was established using an outside-in technique. A shaver was introduced in the\nsubacromial space, and a thorough bursectomy and debridement was performed. Rotator cuff\nwas inspected. This was a crescent tear.\nThe footprint was then prepared using a bur to provide a nice healing surface. 2 Smith &\nNephew 4.75 Healicoil Double-loaded REGENESORB suture anchor were then placed at the\narticular margin. All strands of suture were passed at the appropriate distance.

Here is a case report of a beach chair-style shoulder replacement performed by a team of surgeons at the University of California, Los Angeles, after the patient was mistaken for the wrong surgeon. We report the case of a 30-year-old man with a history of shoulder problems who presented to the emergency department with a suspected torn labrum. This is a case report of arthroscopic shoulder surgery on a young man with a history of shoulder problems and a previous shoulder operation that was not recommended for his condition. Here is a case report of a young man who had a partial tear of the articular cartilage in his left foot and had a successful surgery to repair it. The biceps tendon was found to be attached to the flexor digita flexor muscle on the outside of the biceps femoris, on the inside of the ulnar collateral ligament.

The patient\nhas tried and failed conservative treatment. The patient has an MRI showing a full-thickness\nrotator cuff tear. They wished to proceed with surgery, fully understanding risks, benefits, pros\nand cons.\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nThe patient was seen in the preoperative area where the history, physical examination, and\ninformed consent was reviewed. The patient understood all risks and benefits of surgery\nincluding the risk of infection, the risk of damage to nearby nerves, arteries, veins, tendons,\nneed for subsequent operation, implant failure or loosening, failure of repair, retear, stiffness.\nThe patient wished to proceed. Right upper extremity was marked. Regional anesthetic block\nwas placed to the Right upper extremity by the Anesthesia team.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table. Timeout\nwas performed, confirming the patient's correct identification as well as the correct operative\nsite. IV Ancef was given as infection prophylaxis. General anesthesia was induced without\ncomplications. The patient was placed in the beach chair position with all bony prominences\nwell-padded, and the Right upper extremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.\nTimeout was performed prior to incision.\nPosterior arthroscopic portal was established. Diagnostic arthroscopy was performed\nconfirming the following: Degenerative fraying of the anterior superior posterior labrum. Articular\ncartilage fraying of the humeral head and glenoid with no full-thickness cartilage defect. Intact\nsubscapularis. Long head of the biceps tendon fraying. Large full-thickness tear of the\nsupraspinatus extending into the infraspinatus with retraction. Intact posterior cuff\nAt this point, a rotator interval portal was established, and a shaver was introduced in the joint.\nDebridement of the degenerative labral fraying was performed. Debridement of articular\ncartilage of the humeral head and glenoid was performed. Debridement of the rotator interval\nsynovitis and capsule was performed. A straight biter was used to perform a biceps tenotomy for\nlater tenodesis and the residual stump was debrided with the shaver. The scope was then\nmoved to the subacromial space using the previously established posterior arthroscopic portal.\nLateral portal was established using an outside-in technique. A shaver was introduced in the\nsubacromial space, and a thorough bursectomy and debridement was performed. Rotator cuff\nwas inspected. This was a crescent tear.\nThe footprint was then prepared using a bur to provide a nice healing surface. 2 Smith &\nNephew 4.75 Healicoil Double-loaded REGENESORB suture anchor were then placed at the\narticular margin. All strands of suture were passed at the appropriate distance. Once these\nwere passed, these were tied to compress the tendon to the articular margin and all strands\nwere kept for a lateral row repair, half were taken anterior, half posterior, and 2 Smith & Nephew\n5.5 Healicoil Knotless REGENESORB, compressing the tendon nicely over the footprint. At this\npoint I performed arthroscopic biceps tenodesis. Viewing from lateral. I placed my cannula\nanteriorly.

Sutures were passed in horizontal mattress configuration second suture\nwas passed in cerclage configuration. Sutures were tied. Proximal tendon was debrided. Final\npictures were taken.\nArthroscopic portals were closed using 3-0 nylon in arthroscopic mattress fashion and dressed\nwith Xeroform, 4x4, ABD pad, and stretchy tape. A shoulder immobilizer was applied. The\npatient was awoken from general anesthesia without complications and transferred to the PACU\nin stable condition.\nPOSTOPERATIVE PLAN:\nThe patient will be nonweightbearing Right upper extremity.
